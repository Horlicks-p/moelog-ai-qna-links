=== ðŸš€ GEO Module Features (v1.6.0+) ===

**What is GEO?**
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) makes your AI-generated Q&A content more discoverable by next-generation AI search engines like Google SGE, Bing Copilot, and Perplexity.

**When enabled, the GEO module adds:**

âœ“ **Schema.org QAPage** structured data for each answer
âœ“ **Open Graph & Twitter Card** meta tags for social sharing
âœ“ **Breadcrumb navigation** structured data
âœ“ **Removes noindex** restriction - allows search engines to index AI answers
âœ“ **Optimized caching** (24-hour public cache with stale-while-revalidate)
âœ“ **Auto-ping Google & Bing** when new content is published
âœ“ **Major search bot allowlist** - ensures Google/Bing crawlers can access your content

**Enable GEO Mode:**
1. Go to Settings â†’ Moelog AI Q&A
2. Scroll to "GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)" section
3. Check "Enable structured data, SEO optimization & AI Sitemap"
4. Go to Settings â†’ Permalinks and click "Save Changes" to refresh rewrite rules

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate it from Plugins â†’ Installed Plugins
3. Go to Settings â†’ Moelog AI Q&A and configure your API key and model
4. **(Optional)** Enable GEO mode for search engine optimization
5. Edit a post and add your Q&A list under "AI question list" meta box (one question per line)
6. The question list will automatically appear at the bottom of each post
7. (Optional) Use shortcodes to display questions manually:
   - `[moelog_aiqna]` - Display entire question list
   - `[moelog_aiqna index="1"]` - Display only question #1
   - `[moelog_aiqna index="3"]` - Display only question #3

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the new shortcode features? =

**Display entire list:**
```
[moelog_aiqna]
```

**Display individual questions:**
```
First paragraph of your post...

[moelog_aiqna index="1"]

Second paragraph...

[moelog_aiqna index="2"]

Third paragraph...
```

**Important:** When you use any shortcode in your post, the automatic question list at the bottom will be hidden to prevent duplicates.

= What's the difference between automatic display and shortcodes? =

- **Automatic**: Questions appear at the bottom of each post automatically (no shortcode needed)
- **Shortcode `[moelog_aiqna]`**: Manually place the entire question list anywhere in your content
- **Shortcode `[moelog_aiqna index="N"]`**: Place individual questions throughout your content for better contextual integration

= How do I enable AI answers? =
Go to Settings â†’ Moelog AI Q&A, fill in your API key (OpenAI or Gemini),
and select your preferred model. Then, edit a post and add your questions.

= What is GEO mode and should I enable it? =
GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) helps AI search engines like Google SGE and Bing Copilot discover and cite your content.

**Enable GEO if:**
- You want your AI answers to appear in AI search results
- You're building a knowledge base or FAQ site
- You want search engines to index your AI-generated content

**Keep it disabled if:**
- Your content is for members only
- You don't want AI answers indexed by search engines
- You prefer traditional SEO without structured data

= Where can I find the AI Q&A Sitemap? =
- Sitemap is not available right now

= How do I clear cached AI answers? =
Go to Settings â†’ Moelog AI Q&A â†’ Cache Management section.

You can:
- **Clear all cache**: Remove all cached answers (useful after changing AI model or prompts)
- **Clear single cache**: Remove cache for a specific question (useful when an answer is incorrect)

= Can I change the look of the question list? =
Yes, the plugin loads its own lightweight CSS file (assets/style.css).
You can override styles from your theme's stylesheet.

= What does the "Temperature" setting do? =
The "Temperature" value controls how creative or deterministic the AI's answers will be.

- **Lower value (0.2â€“0.3)**: More focused and consistent answers, suitable for factual or technical topics.
- **Higher value (0.7â€“1.0)**: Increases creativity and randomness, useful for brainstorming or open-ended questions.

For most blog-related Q&A use cases, a setting around **0.3** is recommended.

= Can I include the post content for better context? =
Yes. Check "Include post content in AI context" in the settings page.
It sends part of your post to the AI for more relevant answers.

= Does GEO mode affect my site's performance? =
No. GEO mode only adds lightweight structured data (JSON-LD) to answer pages,
which has minimal impact on page load time. The 24-hour cache actually improves performance.
